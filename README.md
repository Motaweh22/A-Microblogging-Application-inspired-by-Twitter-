A Microblogging Application [inspired by Twitter]
Microblogging is an online broadcast medium that exists as a specific form of blogging. A micro-blog differs from a
traditional blog in that its content is typically smaller in size. Micro-blogs "allow users to exchange small elements of
content such as short sentences, individual images, or video links", which may be the major reason for their popularity.
These small messages are sometimes called micro posts. Twitter (as an example of a Microblogging & Social Networking
Service) is an application on which users post and interact with messages known as "tweets". Registered users can post,
like, and retweet tweets, but unregistered users can only read those that are publicly available. Tweets are publicly visible
by default, but senders can restrict message delivery to only their followers. Users can mute users they do not wish to
interact with, block accounts from viewing their tweets, and remove accounts from their followers' list. Users may
subscribe to other users' tweetsâ€”this is known as "following" and subscribers are known as "followers". Individual tweets
can be forwarded by other users to their own feed, a process known as a "retweet". A "quote tweet" (originally called
"retweet with comment") is a feature that allows users to add a comment to their retweet, nesting one tweet in the other.
Users can also "like" (formerly "favorite") individual tweets. The counters for "likes", "retweets", and replies appear next
to the respective buttons in timelines such as on profile pages and search results. Counters for likes and retweets exist on
a tweet's standalone page too. Quote tweets, formerly known as "retweet with comment", have their own counter on
their tweet page. For ideas on more features, you may check: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Twitter_features
